# Listings123-eda
EDA project based in Google Sheets/Excel from Pathstream course

Project Overview
In the final project for this course, you will perform an exploratory data analysis on a given data set. You must discover patterns, spot anomalies, frame hypotheses, and check assumptions in Google Sheets. You will visualize data, calculate main characteristics, and understand data and find possible new hypotheses. You will also identify project stakeholders, apply business framing solutions and communicate analytics insights to the appropriate audience. 

This is a final project from a course within the Tableau Data Analytics program. The goal was to perform exploratory data analysis on Listing123's (fictional, AirB&B like company) 2020 data set.

Project Problem: Listing123 does not have enough funding for a nationwide marketing campaign. In order to recieve funding from investors and VCs, they must report on the traits that make a listing successful.
